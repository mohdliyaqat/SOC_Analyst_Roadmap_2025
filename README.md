# SOC Analyst Roadmap 2025: My Journey to Cybersecurity in Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º

## About Me
Hi there! I'm Mohammed Liyaqat Al Zama, a recent Computer Science Engineering graduate (July 2025) with a strong passion for cybersecurity and its practical application in defending digital assets. My goal is to become a job-ready SOC Analyst in Australia by the December 2025 intake, leveraging hands-on skills and continuous learning.

This repository documents my intensive 90-day self-study roadmap, designed to build practical cybersecurity competencies and secure my first role in Australia's dynamic tech landscape.

## My Roadmap Phases:
This journey is structured into three key phases, each building upon the last:

1.  **Phase 1: Foundational Mastery & Core Concepts** (Weeks 1-4)
    * Focus: Linux, Windows, Networking, SOC Fundamentals, Cyber Kill Chain, MITRE ATT&CK.
2.  **Phase 2: Specialization & Certification Drive** (Weeks 5-9)
    * Focus: SIEM (Splunk/Sentinel), EDR, Incident Response, CompTIA Security+, Security Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1).
3.  **Phase 3: Portfolio, Application & Networking Blitz** (Weeks 10-13)
    * Focus: Advanced certifications (CompTIA CySA+), portfolio refinement, job applications, interview prep, and professional networking.
