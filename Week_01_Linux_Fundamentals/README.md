# Week 01: Linux Fundamentals Mastery

## Goal Achieved:
Became comfortable navigating and interacting with Linux systems via the command line.

## Modules & Resources Completed:
* **TryHackMe:**
    * [cite_start]"Linux Fundamentals Part 1" [cite: 1] (Reviewed & Practiced)
    * [cite_start]"Linux Fundamentals Part 2" [cite: 1] (Reviewed & Practiced)
    * [cite_start]"Linux Fundamentals Part 3" [cite: 1] (Reviewed & Practiced)
* **YouTube/Medium:** Utilized supplementary explanations and practical walkthroughs by searching for "Linux CLI basic commands for cybersecurity" or "Linux file system navigation." [cite_start]Specifically leveraged channels like "The Cyber Mentor" [cite: 16] [cite_start]and "NetworkChuck"[cite: 16].
* [cite_start]**Built-in Help:** Actively practiced using `man` pages for various commands (e.g., `man ls`)[cite: 17].
* **Wargames:** OverTheWire Bandit (Started basic levels to apply command-line skills).

## Hands-on Application & Key Achievements:
* [cite_start]**Linux VM Setup:** Successfully set up a dedicated Linux VM (Kali Linux) using VirtualBox (free) on my personal machine for practice[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]**GitHub Portfolio Initiative:** Started a GitHub repository and created a `Linux_Cheatsheet.md` file to add commands and concepts as I learned them, building part of my public portfolio[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]**Consistent Practice:** Maintained a daily habit of spending at least 2-3 hours on learning modules and hands-on practice[cite: 22].

## Key Concepts Explored & Practiced (Reflected in Cheatsheet):
* [cite_start]Basic navigation (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`) [cite: 9]
* File & directory manipulation (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`)
* File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
* User & group management (`useradd`, `userdel`, `sudo`)
* Process & service management (`ps`, `top`, `kill`, `systemctl`)
* File searching & filtering (`find`, `grep`, `locate`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`)
* Basic networking commands (`ip`, `ping`, `netstat`)
* Introduction to Bash scripting fundamentals

## Challenges & Learnings:
* Initially found command syntax and remembering various options challenging, but consistent daily practice was key to overcoming this.
* Discovered the power of `man` pages for quick reference and in-depth command information.
* Recognized the value of consistent, hands-on practice in a VM environment to solidify theoretical knowledge.

## Relevant Files & Projects:
* [My Comprehensive Linux Cheatsheet](Linux_Cheatsheet.md)
* [OverTheWire Bandit Wargame Write-ups](../Wargame_Writeups/README.md) *(Note: This link assumes you create the Wargame_Writeups folder at the root level later)*

## Why This Matters for SOC Analysis:
A strong foundation in Linux command-line skills is fundamental for SOC Analysts. It's essential for investigating incidents on Linux servers, analyzing log data efficiently, performing initial forensics, and managing security tools, all of which are critical for effective threat detection and response.
